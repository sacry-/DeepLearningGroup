# DeepLearningGroup
Deep Learning Goup for Students of Hamburg

  - We meet every 2 weeks
  - We discuss and present in English
  - 1-2 person(s) prepare and present a specific paper, problem or topic. This can range from paper presentation to covering a topic, a specific problem that needs to be solved or even live coding. The "talks" should be around 15-30 minutes with a discussion afterwards.
  - We want to cultivate a culture of collaboration that exceeds the meetings
